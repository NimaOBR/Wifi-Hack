# WiFi-Hack [Windows Reverse Shellüë∫]
**`This is a fake WiFi hacking tool for Windows reverse shell access, designed for educational purposes.üòÅ`**
At first glance, it appears to be a Python script for hacking WiFi. It has the ability to scan surrounding networks. After scanning the surrounding networks and entering the name of the network, you can "crack" its password in a simulated manner. In the background, you can control the Windows system of the person running the script via a Telegram bot and execute system commands remotely.

<h2>How to Use This Python Script:</h2>
<li>Support my work: In the first step, please support my work by (https://github.com/isecbaz). This will encourage me to share more advanced penetration testing tools with you in the future.</li>
<br>
<li>Download and modify the code: Download the code and go to line 47. Replace the placeholder token with your own Telegram bot token. To get your token, create a bot using BotFather@ on Telegram, then enter the token into the source code and save it.</li>
<br>
<li>Start your Telegram bot: Start your Telegram bot. After running the WiFi-Hack.py script, you can send /start in Telegram to execute system commands. For example, in the image, I have executed the hostname command, and the result is shown.</li>

**`üëáWhat can I do to improve the performance of this script?ü§î`**
<li>To convert Python code into an executable file (exe), you can use tools like PyInstaller, Py2Exe, or cx_Freeze.</li>
<br>
<li>In addition to converting your Python code into an executable file, you can also use tools like PyMinifier, PyObfuscate, or Pycryptodome to obfuscate and encrypt your code.</li>
<br>
<li>Please note that Windows reverse shell does not require setting up a VPS and other such things. The best method is to use Telegram. However, keep in mind that Telegram is filtered in countries like Iran, etc., and you need to turn on VPN or use the method https://github.com/isecbaz/glitch to use it.</li>

<h3>üëáInstalling Dependencies:üëá</h3>
<li>Python Version 3</li>
<br>
<li>pip install colorama</li>
<br>
<li>pip install telepot</li>
<br>

>As I explained, this is a simple tool for Windows reverse shell. You can edit the code according to your needs. The purpose of sharing this Python script is to demonstrate the different aspects of Windows reverse shell. Farewell.
